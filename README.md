# **Overview**

The SafeNet App Gateway is designed to enable integration with unauthenticated applications that don't follow standard way of communication through SAML 2.0 or OIDC protocols. Customers would benefit with availability of a generic way to integrate with their non-standard apps. With this application gateway, the users can utilise the inbuilt features of STA like two-factor authentication, adaptive access and SSO, and bring them to their native application platforms.

Please refer to STA documentation for more information about SafeNet App Gateway.

# **Accessing the Image**

To load the image from Docker Hub the &#39;docker pull&#39; command should be used. The image name should be supplied with the pull command, along with a tag which corresponds to the image version number. For example:

docker pull thalesgroup/application-gateway:1.0.0

# **How to use this image**

**Download the docker-compose.yml by using the below command:-**

wget -O- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThalesGroup/application-gateway/main/docker-compose.yml" > ./docker-compose.yml

docker-compose.yml for application-gateway:

      version: "3.3"

      services:

        application-gateway:

          image: "artifactory.thalesdigital.io/docker-public/application-gateway:latest"

          container_name: application-gateway

          ports:

            - "443:9443"

            - "8443:8443"

         environment:

            ADMIN_CONSOLE_USER: admin

            ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD: admin

         logging:

            driver: "json-file"

            options:

              max-file: "5"

              max-size: "50m"

        restart: always

The following environment variables are used for configuring login credentials for application-gateway Admin Console

- ADMIN_CONSOLE_USER=... (defaults to "admin")
- ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD=... (defaults to "admin")

The default port mapping are as-

- 443:9443= serves requests from users and proxies the connection to internal services.
- 8443:8443= for configuring application-gateway(used for administrative purposes). Port 8443 should not be publicly exposed and restrict traffic to authorized networks only.
Or to allow access of Application Gateway admin console only from local server, map external port number with localhost
like : 127.0.0.1:8443:8443

# **Examine the log file of the container.**

docker logs -f application-gateway, where application-gateway is container name.

# **Documentation**

The official documentation of the SafeNet Agent for Application Gateway is available at SafeNet Trusted Access (STA).
